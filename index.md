You can use the [open source](https://github.com/Urunov/orm.github.io/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain for your projects.

-------------



### Mapping (Hibernate)

* Hibernate is an open source Java persistence framework project. 

* It performs powerful object-relational mapping and query databases using HQL and SQL. Hibernate is a great tool for ORM mappings in Java. ​

* It can cut down a lot of complexity and thus defects as well from your application, which may otherwise find a way to exist. ​

* This is specially boon for developers with limited knowledge of SQL.

No Mapping example, there is no any annotation for integrating tables. Just individually represents.
